# 1. Stack implementation using Doubly-linked-list

## Why doubly linked list?
let's see by looking at the time complexity

push(): O(1)

pop(): O(1)

Empty(): O(1)

top_element(): O(1)

size_of_stack(): As we traversed the whole list, it will be O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

display(): As we traversed the whole list, it will be O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

## Other factors:

It can be seen that most of the operations can be performed in constant time.

Also the size of stack can be varied as per the requirement.
